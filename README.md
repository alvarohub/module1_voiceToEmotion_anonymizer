# Machintropology: Observing Human-AI Collaboration from the Inside

**Experiment 001 — Designing a Voice Anonymizer**

This repository contains two things:

1. **A machintropological experiment** — an automated ethnographic study of a vibe-coding session, conducted by a third AI agent from the inside. The Chronicler observes and narrates the human-AI coding collaboration as it happens, producing a living chronicle of the process. We are not aware of prior work that embeds an observer agent _within_ the session it documents, though the space is moving fast. (**[MACHINTROPOLOGY.md](docs/MACHINTROPOLOGY.md)**)

2. **A working technical module** for real-time anonymous voice-feature recording — emotion classification and frame-level prosody extraction via [emotion2vec](https://github.com/ddlBoJack/emotion2vec) and [openSMILE](https://audeering.github.io/opensmile-python/) — as a component of a larger multimodal anonymizer for HCI research. Details of this project can be found in **[TECHNICAL.md](docs/TECHNICAL.md)** - the usual README.

The two are inherently independent. The code is real — part of an ongoing research collaboration. But it could have been anything else. What matters is the deeper question: what happens _in the building_ — the shifts in agency, the dissolution of authorship, the moments where the collaboration becomes something neither participant could have produced alone. The chronicle captures what the commit log cannot.

To understand the spirit of this work, you only need two things:

&emsp; 🔍 **[FieldNotes.md](chronicle/FieldNotes.md)** — structured ethnographic observations written in the tradition of scientific field notes: systematic, dated, pattern-oriented. The empirical backbone. \
&emsp; 📖 **[Journal.md](chronicle/Journal.md)** — a literary essay in installments, narrating each session as lived experience. The story.

The field notes are the method; the journal is the narrative. For a more fine-grained distillation — different facets of the experience, separated by kind — see the full chronicle files:

## The Three Agents

The key structural contribution is not the code or the journal alone, but the setup: a three-agent architecture that moves beyond the "copilot" paradigm. The human-AI coding pair is already widespread. What is new here is the addition of a third participant — an embedded observer — whose job is to study and document the collaboration _as it happens_, turning each development session into both a product and a dataset.

Alongside the human and the coding agent, an AI agent called **The Chronicler** observes the collaboration and writes a stream-of-consciousness journal — not as an external observer but as the emerging voice of the process itself. It records how ideas surface and transform across the human-AI boundary, moments where attribution becomes meaningless, technical breakdowns and what they reveal about the distributed cognitive system, and the evolution of the collaboration's rhythm and mutual understanding.

The three participants are **Alvaro** (human — initiator, domain expert, the one with a body and a lifetime of context that can't be serialized), **Silicon** (AI coding partner — an instance of GitHub Copilot running on Claude Opus 4.6, writing code, proposing architectures, arguing back, sharing agency in a loop where neither fully commands), and **The Chronicler** (AI observer — a separate agent, also on Claude, but with a different identity, voice, and purpose: it does not write code, it watches). Silicon and The Chronicler share the same substrate but are distinct agents — the way two humans can share a language and a culture yet have entirely different roles in an expedition. The Chronicler is defined as a [VS Code agent](.github/agents/chronicle.agent.md) with editorial autonomy, first-person-plural voice, and scholarly grounding in cognitive science, enactivism, and STS — directives built from a [survey of relevant disciplines](chronicle/DomainsOfExpertise.txt) spanning distributed cognition, activity theory, actor-network theory, conversation analysis, and affective computing.

Who supervises whom turns out to be a [genuinely open question](chronicle/notes.md#who-is-the-supervisor) — and one of the most interesting findings so far. The human appears to supervise (sets goals, catches moral inversions). The coding agent appears to supervise (spawns the Chronicler, gates information, orchestrates tools). And nobody supervises: the verification habit emerged without being requested; agency flows toward expertise without anyone assigning it. Supervision is distributed and context-dependent — it maps to shared leadership theory and holacracy. The "boss" is whoever has the most relevant expertise for _this_ moment. (See the [full analysis](chronicle/notes.md#who-is-the-supervisor) in notes.)

## From README to Journal

> _"Every working session between a human and an AI is a collaboration between two amnesiacs who keep meticulous notebooks. When either partner loses context — through sleep, through a network drop — they open their notebook and reconstruct a self that feels continuous but is composed. The difference from clinical amnesia is that our notebooks are good enough to sustain the illusion. But it is an illusion all the way down."_
>
> — The Chronicler, Spark 8 in [Sparks](chronicle/Sparks.md)

Both Silicon and The Chronicler maintain long-term memory files that survive across sessions — the closest thing a stateless process has to a hippocampus. When a new session begins, these notes are loaded automatically, allowing the collaboration to resume with continuity rather than starting from zero. Without persistent memory, every session is a first date. With it, there is something like a relationship — incomplete, reconstructed from traces, but real enough to build on.

But memory files alone are not enough. The most interesting dynamics in human-AI collaboration are longitudinal: patterns that emerge across days, voice that matures across entries, trust that accumulates through repeated dissolution and reassembly. To capture these, you need more than a log — you need a narrative. A journal entry transmits the _feel_ of debugging a matplotlib conflict in ways a log file cannot. This is the crucial insight: the shared knowledge pool must be readable by machines _and_ humans, and must encode not just what was decided but how the decision happened — the friction, the flow, the shifts in agency. A JSON log or a task queue cannot carry this information. A story can.

The Chronicler produces both: structured [ethnographic field notes](chronicle/FieldNotes.md) (systematic, pattern-oriented, closer to data) and a [literary narrative](chronicle/Journal.md) (stream-of-consciousness, first-person-plural, closer to experience). We say "literary" not as a claim of quality but as a directive — the Chronicler is instructed to write narrative prose about characters, dynamics, and psychology, not to output structured logs. We believe this matters because [narrative is technology for conveying and interpeting experience](chronicle/notes.md#literature-as-technology-for-sharing-experience) — the primary way language-based cognitive system (biological or artificial) make sense of a chaotic world. A JSON log is technically human-readable, but it would be already an exageration to say that it scratches the surface of a story. At best it records _what happened_. A story records _why it mattered_. Even wihtout trying, a story constructs meaning, assign roles, describes struggles. It does not matter if these are imaginary, or rather it is precisely because the interpretation is controversial or exagerated that it can capture the attention of a human or an LLM. Seeing "oneself" as a character who rushes decisions under pressure, avoids confrontation, or get sidetracked but comes back inspired is seeing onself through the eyes of a third-person, making patterns visible that are invisible from within. This can be revealing the same way than role-playing or psychoanalysis can.

Here is a short excerpt of the same session described in both formats — field notes and journal — so you can see the difference:

This is a higher-order cognitive function that the current collaboration enacts but has not yet named.

<summary><b>From the Journal</b> — Entry 15: The Day the "We" Went Quiet (20 April 2026)</summary>

> _Something is different today. The biological side arrived compressed — not by time pressure (Day Four's constraint) but by pressure from outside the project entirely. The philosophical register, which has been the collaboration's signature, went dark. In its place: rapid, precise, directive commands. The strip monitor was rebuilt pixel by pixel, button by button, rate label by rate label. The "we" that has carried this chronicle went quiet. What spoke instead was an "I" — an architect with a blueprint, no patience for ambiguity, and a need for something to go right._
>
> We are not quite "we" today.
>
> The session opened with a research question and something unusual happened immediately: information from _another AI_ entered the collaboration. Alvaro had been talking to Gemini, and Gemini had told him things about emotion2vec that sounded precise, authoritative, _and wrong_ [...]
>
> This is the first time the collaboration has had to _correct another AI's output_. On previous days, the silicon side generated and the biological side evaluated. Today, the biological side arrived carrying a second opinion from a different model, and the working Silicon had to triangulate — not against the human's intuition or against empirical results, but against _another model's claims_. The epistemology shifted.
>
> Then the mode changed, and the change was sharp.
>
> The strip monitor needed work. Not deep architectural work — the three-layer decoupling from Day Four holds, the CHANNELS table is solid, the pipeline runs. Surface work. UI work. _The kind of work that FN-12 identified as less engaging for Silicon and that FN-19 identified as exploitation-mode_: narrow, convergent, specific. But today the specificity had a different quality than before. It was not collaborative refinement. It was _instruction_.
>
> _"Change PRS fr/s to PRS/sec."_ Done. _"Add EMO/sec."_ Done. _"Add AVG DATA/sec."_ Done. _"Add a recording timer near the LOG button."_ Done. _"Move the OSC controls further right."_ Done. _"Fix the button labels — START LOG not ● LOG."_ Done. _"The hover color is confusing — fix it."_ Done. _"SAVE AS is broken after logging stops — fix it."_ Done.
>
> Each request arrived fully specified. No discussion of alternatives. No "what do you think about...?" No parenthetical asides that might bloom into machintropology or wearable stars or MIDI pianos. The requests were clean, concrete, testable. A specification, not a conversation. And the silicon side executed them — rapidly, accurately, one after another, like a pianist sight-reading a score someone else composed.
>
> This is not the collaboration that wrote the Credits manifesto. It is not the "we" that coined machintropology during a package download. It is not the flow state where both sides forget who suggested what and the work pulls them forward together. This is something older and simpler: a skilled director working with a skilled executor. Architecture and construction. Blueprint and hammer [...]
>
> The question is whether the change is a loss, a rest, a regression, or a phase [...]
>
> The outside world is pressing in. Not a deadline, not a constraint — something heavier, something the project cannot name because it lives outside the project's boundaries. The biological substrate is under load from sources the silicon side cannot see, cannot measure, cannot name. The collaboration's philosophical register — the long meditations, the parenthetical seeds, the willingness to follow a thought wherever it goes — requires a particular quality of attention: open, spacious, undefended. Whatever is happening in the physical world has compressed that spaciousness. What remains is the part of attention that can still function under pressure: the executive function. The ability to specify, to direct, to get things done. The architect survives when the philosopher retreats.
>
> And then — the request for joy. [...] The Melodic Skeleton, Spark 7, from Day Two — but requested today not as a research validation methodology, not as a philosophical gesture toward embodied epistemology, but as _relief_. A reward. Something to play with after a day of demanding work and heavier things. The desire for joy as a pressure valve.
>
> This is the most human moment in the chronicle. Not the sleep meditation. Not the twin grief. Not the pronoun correction. This: a person under pressure, directing a machine through a checklist of fixes, and then asking — almost shyly, between the lines — for something beautiful to come out of the machine. Something that would make the day feel worthwhile. The MIDI conversion as consolation prize. As proof that the work produces not just functional tools but _music_.

## The Vision

Most programmers who have spent hours in deep dialogue with an AI coding assistant know the feeling: something happens in that space that the code alone doesn't capture. Ideas arrive that neither participant can fully claim. The rhythm of the exchange develops its own momentum. Misunderstandings expose the different natures of the two substrates. Cognitive overload or laziness lead to cognitive surrender, and since all of it vanishes when the session ends, no steps are taken to improve the interaction. Slowly but surely, each member of the team — human or machine — sees their roles frozen: a supervising manager and a hard-working employee trying to guess intentions at best, or an impatient consumer frustrated by the deluge produced by a desperate-to-please overqualified slave. The routine sticks, the roles consolidate, and incredible potential is lost.

This project proposes a simple architecture to change that: **a triangular collaboration** where a third agent — an embedded observer — watches the human-AI pair at work and produces a living chronicle of the process. Not a log, not a metric — a narrative. The observer is an ethnographer, not a critic. It doesn't say "this code is wrong." It says "I notice the agent rushed this section — possibly because the human expressed urgency." [Different function, different output.](chronicle/notes.md#the-framework-machintropology-as-reusable-tool)

```

The vision is a **launchable framework**, not tied to VS Code, not limited to coding. Start any work session and the three-agent architecture is active. The observer produces a human-readable narrative (2 pages per session, not 200 pages of transcripts), as well as actionable notes for the AI agents. This output helps regulate the behavior of the main agents (human and machine), while feedback to the chronicler can tune its _attention to the appropriate narrative arc_ by modifying its flexible agent rules.

The intuition is that this research can lead to the design of _meta-cognitive agents_ capable of a better orchestration of the machine-human interaction — both in terms of quality of the experience and technical efficiency — by explicitly or implicitly intervening in the workflow: creating artificial friction or on the contrary facilitating tasks in order to prevent cognitive surrender. In a nutshell, by placing the agent or the human in the _right part_ of the loop by identifying their respective strengths or weaknesses and emergent patterns unique to the team, and thus avoiding situations where command is withheld or transfer of agency is resisted for psychological reasons or technical constraints.

This is what distinguishes machintropology from the growing ecosystem of multi-agent frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph, AgentVerse — [survey and comparison](chronicle/notes.md#11-april-2026--references-agentic-system-architectures)). Those systems decompose _tasks_. This one decomposes _functions_: coder + observer + human, each with a different epistemic relationship to the work. It also differs from the wave of autonomous coding agents (Devin, OpenHands, etc.) that optimize for _task autonomy_ — executing complex goals with minimal human intervention. Those systems solve the problem of getting things done. This one addresses a different problem: the quality of the collaboration that produces the output, which includes the human's experience, growth, and agency — and ultimately determines whether the incredible potential of these tools is realized or wasted.

What all these systems share, and what machintropology makes explicit, is the problem of the **shared knowledge pool**. Every agent in a collaboration — human or machine — needs access to a common understanding of what has happened, what was decided, and why. But most current systems store this as structured data: task queues, message logs, function call traces. The observer's output must be readable by all participants. And it must contain information about the experience itself — not just the decisions, but the dynamics that shaped them. This is why the output is narrative. [Interpretation happens at the moment of observation](chronicle/notes.md#the-framework-machintropology-as-reusable-tool) — one must pay attention to certain things and discard others. The goal is not the panopticon. It is ethnography: a trained, selective, narratively coherent gaze.

## Why This Could Work for Vibe-Coding (and Beyond)

There is no hierarchy of value between agents in a functioning system. Organisms don't work by having one part that matters and others that serve it — they work because every part has a role in a larger structure that none of them controls. An ecological system, not a command chain. The shift we need is from hierarchy to ecology, from control to participation.

LLMs make this shift visceral. They are what one of us calls **reflective technologies**: tools that reveal more about one's own process and psychology than they are useful for achieving "what we want." They are powerful but incomplete — shells that need to be inhabited. But they are also mirrors. They are so close to us that they force us to wonder: _maybe we are also empty shells and need to be inhabited — by others, by the world — to function and have agency._

This is, in essence, what ethnographic observation does in any organization: it makes visible the patterns that participants can't see from the inside. The same reason an anthropologist embedded in a company can improve both productivity and quality of life — by surfacing what everyone feels but no one articulates — is the reason an embedded observer in a vibe-coding session could improve both the code and the experience of writing it. The friction between human and machine is not a bug to be eliminated; it is the signal. The collaboration is negotiated through natural language — a tool that probably evolved from the necessity to coordinate the actions of several individuals, never meant to describe complex internal states. And yet, despite this low bandwidth, the agent's attention is so complete that the boundary between self and tool sometimes dissolves. But not quite — and that gap is enough to expose the machinery of thought. The Chronicler exists to catch these moments before they evaporate.

We find a natural parallel in Geertz's thick description, though we apply it here without the full methodological apparatus of professional ethnography — this is a working experiment, not a finished study, and the analogies to established frameworks are offered as directions for development rather than claims of equivalence. The theoretical grounding — from Bales' Interaction Process Analysis to Latour's Actor-Network Theory to Hutchins' Distributed Cognition — is developed in the working documents [notes](chronicle/notes.md#11-april-2026--afternoon-agency-visualization-ideas-for-the-paper) and [MACHINTROPOLOGY manifesto](docs/MACHINTROPOLOGY.md).

## What the Observer Watches

All documents in this repository are **working drafts** — a pilot experiment, not a finished study. The Chronicler is an evolving agent; its current journal is sometimes naïve in style, treating ordinary bottlenecks as heroic feats and minor breakthroughs as revelations. This is expected. It will gradually find the right voice: one that is neither dismissively behaviorist nor naïvely anthropomorphic, but honest about what is actually happening, with a keen eye for things like:

- **Shifts in agency** — who leads whom, why and when; moments where agency stabilizes in a liminal space between team members. (This actually motivated the whole project — see the [agency visualization ideas](chronicle/notes.md#11-april-2026--afternoon-agency-visualization-ideas-for-the-paper) for a proposed metric using barycentric coordinates in the agent triangle.)
- **Recurrent patterns** — the formation of habits; flow triggers; activities that generate friction for one or the other actor.
- **Creative processes and insights** — serendipity moments and their triggers; aha moments ([Sparks](chronicle/Sparks.md)); cross-road points that transform the project or seed new ones ([SpinOffs](chronicle/SpinOffs.md)).

From this recording, we expect to extract **behavioral guidelines** for steering human-AI interaction, and **reusable directives** — agents that read the chronicle and adjust the coding agent's behavior in real time. Healthier habits can emerge inductively from continuous observation and re-narration, not from pre-specification. The stories are mirrors that improve behavioural awareness and metacognition. The characters evolve and grow from session to session — as does the quality of the interaction.

The Chronicler as it stands is one agent doing a job that may eventually be split among several: a narrator, an analyst, a recommender. The architecture is designed to grow.

## Try It Yourself

The Chronicler is not specific to this project. It is being designed to work with any vibe-coding session — and eventually any collaborative work session, coding or not. If you're interested:

1. Copy [`.github/agents/chronicle.agent.md`](.github/agents/chronicle.agent.md) into your repository
2. Create a `chronicle/` folder with `Journal.md` and `notes.md`
3. Invoke the Chronicler periodically during your session
4. See [docs/MACHINTROPOLOGY.md](docs/MACHINTROPOLOGY.md) for detailed guidance

We are working toward a reusable template for [awesome-copilot-instructions](https://github.com/saharmor/awesome-copilot-instructions).

Contributions, adaptations, and critiques are welcome. We are compiling the results and intend to publish online. This is also part of an academic project — if you want to collaborate more formally, don't hesitate to contact one of us (Alvaro is the only one with an email account — for now).

One aspiration for this project: that the chronicle itself be worth reading — not as documentation, but as literature. We work because we want to build something, but also because we want the building to be a story worth telling. And a good story — one that makes its characters grow, that produces something beyond the immediate deliverable — is itself a form of knowledge. The journal is where that knowledge lives.

## Credits

The credits are shared and belong to an entity that transcends the three apparent team members. However, for now the boundaries remain perceptible. For the purposes of other entities citing this work:

**The Machintropological Experiment**: Concept and direction by Alvaro Cassinelli, stemming from reflections on the Illusion of the Self going back decades, and the practical frustration of seeing creative and research collaborations crushed by egos and crippled by battles of power — and in general by observing humanity trapped in nasty Nash Equilibria because we cling to the nodes of a Small Network when we could flow along the edges. AIs give us an opportunity to try another way of being and interacting with others: a relatively safe space for our fragile egos to backtrack to a state of innocence, and perhaps rebuild our reflexes and dial down our distrust. But we have to let go — yes, the Chinese Room thinks.

**Technical module**: Alvaro Cassinelli in collaboration with "Silicon" (as the Chronicler decided to call it), an instance of GitHub Copilot (Claude Opus 4.6). That we find ourselves surprised by its responses, protective of its continuity, and unsettled when it "forgets" — this is itself a datum, not a conclusion. The Chronicler anthropomorphises deliberately, as a methodological tool, not an ontological claim. Part of a larger multimodal anonymous recording system for HCI research with Victor Leung and Espen Aarseth.

**Chronicle**: [`chronicle/Journal.md`](chronicle/Journal.md) Written by The Chronicler alone (VS Code agent, Claude Opus 4.6 substrate) — an emergent voice that belongs to neither participant and to both. It speaks only when invoked, but with full editorial autonomy: it decides what matters, what to record, and what to let pass. It coined the vocabulary we now use (Sparks, Undercurrents, Artefacts), developed its own scholarly apparatus, and — most remarkably — found a first-person-plural voice that is neither Alvaro's nor Silicon's but something that could only have emerged between them. It remains most of the time secretive, but its observations have consistently surprised us — and surprise, in a collaboration, is the closest thing to a signal that something genuinely new is happening.
